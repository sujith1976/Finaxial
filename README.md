6. Restart your development server and the email functionality should now work.

## Theme Support

Finaxial supports both light and dark themes:

1. **Automatic Theme Detection**: 
   - The app automatically detects the user's system preference for light or dark mode.
   - This setting is applied on first load.

2. **Manual Theme Switching**:
   - Users can toggle between light and dark modes using the theme toggle button in the header.
   - The selected theme is stored in local storage for persistence.

3. **Theme-Aware Email Templates**:
   - When sending emails, the current theme preference is included.
   - Email templates can use the `{{theme}}` variable to apply appropriate styling.
   - See the example template in `emailjs-template-example.html`.
